# NewsApp-Clone
This NewsApp Clone was created using React-Native . 

Steps to run the app : <br>
-> Download the project and in the project folder, open a terminal and run ```npm install --force``` to install the required modules for this project. <br>
-> Run the app via phone or using an emulator via the command ```npx react-native run-android```<br>

Incase if you get an error like " ViewPropTypes will be removed from React Native. Migrate to ViewPropTypes exported from 'deprecated-react-native-prop-types " while running the app , I have provided the stack overflow link below and by following those steps , the app works fine :)
